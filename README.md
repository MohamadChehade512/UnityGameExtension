VR Paint Sandbox - Read Me

Introduction:

Welcome to the VR Paint Sandbox, an immersive painting experience that takes advantage of VR technology to bring your artistic creations to life! This Unity project is designed for the Oculus Quest platform and serves as an extension of the Magnetic Crane VR Game. In this sandbox, users have the freedom to unleash their creativity by painting trails and drawings in a virtual space.

Development Process:

Unity Version:
This game was developed using Unity, ensuring compatibility with the Oculus Quest platform and XR interaction.

XR Integration:
Building upon the previous Magnetic Crane VR Game, the XR rig system continues to be a core component, allowing users to interact with the virtual environment using Oculus Quest controllers.

Scenes:
Carefully crafted scenes provide an expansive canvas for users to express their creativity. The virtual space offers a blank canvas, and users can freely move around and paint in 3D.

UI/UX Design:
The user interface (UI) is designed to be intuitive and accessible in VR. Various UI functions enhance the painting experience, including options to change paint color, adjust brush size, clear the canvas, and toggle the visibility of the pedestal.

Paint Functions:
Change Color: Use the interactive UI to select different paint colors.
Adjust Brush Size: Customize the size of your virtual brush to create fine details or broad strokes.
Clear Canvas: Press the clear button to remove any paint and start anew.
Toggle Pedestal Visibility: Decide whether to show or hide the pedestal in the virtual space.
Minimize UI: If the UI feels too large, minimize it to create an unobstructed view.

Extending the Magnetic Crane Game:

Evolution of the VR Experience:
The VR Paint Sandbox represents a natural evolution and extension of the Magnetic Crane VR Game, building upon the foundation of XR interactions and immersive gameplay. While the Magnetic Crane Game focused on task-oriented mechanics, the VR Paint Sandbox shifts the focus to a creative and open-ended experience.

Unified XR Integration:
The decision to extend the Magnetic Crane Game into a painting sandbox was rooted in the desire to leverage the existing XR integration seamlessly. By maintaining a consistent XR rig system, users can seamlessly transition from the structured, objective-based gameplay of the magnetic crane to the unbounded canvas of the painting sandbox. This unified XR integration ensures a continuous and familiar user experience across both games.

Leveraging Similar Functions:
The VR Paint Sandbox utilizes similar core functions from the Magnetic Crane Game, creating a sense of continuity for players. The intuitive controls for XR interactions, button functionalities, and UI design principles established in the magnetic crane experience are retained in the painting sandbox. This intentional design choice allows users to carry over their learned behaviors and quickly adapt to the new creative context.

Shared UI Design Philosophy:
The user interface (UI) design philosophy remains consistent between the two games. The interactive UI elements in the VR Paint Sandbox, such as the color palette, brush size adjustment, and clear button, echo the clarity and intuitiveness of the magnetic crane controls. This shared design language promotes a smooth transition for players familiar with the magnetic crane controls, fostering a sense of coherence in the overall gaming experience.

Building a Comprehensive VR Suite:
By extending the Magnetic Crane Game into the VR Paint Sandbox, the development team aims to create a comprehensive VR suite that caters to both task-oriented and creative preferences. Users can choose to engage in the challenging objective-based gameplay of the magnetic crane or switch to the freeform, artistic expression offered by the painting sandbox. This versatile approach ensures that the VR suite appeals to a broader audience with varied interests in virtual reality experiences.

In summary, the VR Paint Sandbox serves as a logical and creative extension of the Magnetic Crane VR Game. By leveraging the existing XR integration, shared UI design principles, and a unified user experience, the development team aims to provide users with a seamless transition between structured tasks and open-ended artistic exploration within the immersive world of virtual reality.
