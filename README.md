VR Paint Sandbox - Read Me

Introduction:

Welcome to the VR Paint Sandbox, an immersive painting experience that takes advantage of VR technology to bring your artistic creations to life! This Unity project is designed for the Oculus Quest platform and serves as an extension of the Magnetic Crane VR Game. In this sandbox, users have the freedom to unleash their creativity by painting trails and drawings in a virtual space.

Development Process:

Unity Version:
This game was developed using Unity, ensuring compatibility with the Oculus Quest platform and XR interaction.

XR Integration:
Building upon the previous Magnetic Crane VR Game, the XR rig system continues to be a core component, allowing users to interact with the virtual environment using Oculus Quest controllers.

Scenes:
Carefully crafted scenes provide an expansive canvas for users to express their creativity. The virtual space offers a blank canvas, and users can freely move around and paint in 3D.

UI/UX Design:
The user interface (UI) is designed to be intuitive and accessible in VR. Various UI functions enhance the painting experience, including options to change paint color, adjust brush size, clear the canvas, and toggle the visibility of the pedestal.

Paint Functions:
Change Color: Use the interactive UI to select different paint colors.
Adjust Brush Size: Customize the size of your virtual brush to create fine details or broad strokes.
Clear Canvas: Press the clear button to remove any paint and start anew.
Toggle Pedestal Visibility: Decide whether to show or hide the pedestal in the virtual space.
Minimize UI: If the UI feels too large, minimize it to create an unobstructed view.
